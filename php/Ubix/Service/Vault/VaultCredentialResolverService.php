/**
 * Resolves the application's database credentials from uBix Vault at process
 * startup and injects them into the environment, so the rest of the app
 * (notably {@see \Ubix\Service\Sql\MysqlPdoSqlService}) keeps reading plain
 * `MYSQL_*` env vars and needs no Vault awareness.
 *
 * Wired into both entry points (`bin/ubix` and `public/index.php`) immediately
 * after Dotenv loads. It is a NO-OP unless `VAULT_ADDR` is set — so local
 * development keeps using a git-ignored `.env`, while deployed pods pull
 * credentials from Vault instead of from any committed secret file.
 *
 * Auth: prefers a static `VAULT_TOKEN` (dev/CI); otherwise, in-cluster, logs in
 * with the Kubernetes auth method using the pod's mounted service-account JWT
 * and `VAULT_K8S_ROLE`. A token obtained by logging in is revoked as soon as the
 * reads are done — it is not needed afterwards, and a token left to expire is a
 * live credential (and a stored record in the vault) until it does. A static
 * `VAULT_TOKEN` is never revoked: it is not this process's to end.
 *
 * Caching: given a cache (APCu in the entry points, see `Bootstrap/vault.php`),
 * the resolved environment is kept for `VAULT_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default 300;
 * 0 disables it), so a PHP-FPM pool logs in to the vault a few times an hour
 * instead of on every request, and a short vault outage does not take requests
 * down with it. Only a complete, successful resolution is cached, keyed on the
 * vault address and every setting that decides what is read; `dynamic` database
 * credentials are never cached (their lease belongs to the vault). A secret
 * rotated in the vault reaches the app within one TTL.
 *
